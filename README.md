# Workbench

A small project for developing and testing small C programs and libraries. This can also be used as a project template of sorts.

**Note:** The source code in this repo will be ever changing as I create and try out new things. This repo exists mostly for my own convenience, however, if you want to use this project structure feel free.

## Building

The `build.bat` file assumes you have the neccessary environment variables set in your terminal to run the MSVC compiler; e.g. from running `vcvarsall.bat`.

You can specify whatever include/library directories, libraries, etc. that you need as neccessary in the `build.bat` file.

Once your environment is setup, just run `build`.
